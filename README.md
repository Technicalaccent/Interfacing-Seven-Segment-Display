Nowadays visual indication is a must feature for any electronic device, which will make user interaction much easier. There are multiple ways to implement the visual indication, from simple light indications to LCDs or even holograms. Today we will be talking about such a device, which has been used in the industry for decades â€“ the seven-segment display.

The seven-segment displays are designed for displaying numeric values. You can find them anywhere from instruments to space shuttles. They are the most practical way to display numeric values. They are cheap and easy to use. Not only that they are highly readable in any light condition, unlike LCDs. You can find them in many everyday usages like counters or token systems etc.
